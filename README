# CommitFest

This application manages commitfests for the PostgreSQL community.

A commitfest is a collection of patches and reviews for a project and is part of the PostgreSQL development process.

## The Application

This is a Django 1.8 application backed by PostgreSQL and running on Python 2.7.

## Getting Started

### Ubuntu instructions

First, prepare your development environment by installing pip, virtualenv, and postgresql-server-dev-X.Y.

$ sudo apt install python-pip postgresql-server-dev-9.6

$ pip install virtualenv

Next, configure your local environment with virtualenv and install local dependencies.

$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py migrate

Now prepare the application to run locally.

First disable the PostgreSQL.org authentication modules by removing the `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` list in pgcommitfest/settings.py. Authentication will default to the built-in Django authentication module. While you're modifying settings.py, set `DEBUG = True` to enable more debugging information.

You'll need either a database dump of the actual server's data or else to create a superuser:

$ python manage.py createsuperuser

Finally, you're ready to start the application:

$ python manage.py runserver
